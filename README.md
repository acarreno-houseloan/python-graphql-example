# GraphQL example

This repository holds a Graphql example using Graphene and Mongoengine.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker compose

## How to run

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000/`. By default the database is empty, but you can add some fake data by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec graphene python -m database.seed --users 10 --posts 10 --comments 10
```

This will create 10 users, 10 posts generated by any random user in the database, and 10 comments on any random post in the database. You can of course change the number of each entity.

## How to query

You can use the GraphiQL interface to query the server. You can access it by going to `http://localhost:8000/`. A simple query would be:

```graphql
{
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

Or you can filter the users by `username`:

```graphql
{
  users(username: "John") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

Filtering can be done on any field defined as argument in each property of `my_graphql.query.Query`.
